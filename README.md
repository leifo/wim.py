# wim.py - WHDLoad Install Manager

WIM is a cross-platform tool that helps you to install and remove
Amiga WHDLoad installs. It is written in Python and known to work on
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

I started the project in 2013 and quickly had a first proof of concept running on Amiga.

It then got refined and forgotten time and time again. Yet, it is almost done.
So this GitHub release is an attempt to somehow revive it from my hard-drive and maybe finish it someday.

If you find this useful, please let me know and do join in!

PS: This repo will be filled with sequential versions, so as to make use of GitHub.

Requirements:
- Python
